# Pac-Man Maze Solver

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project is a Pac-Man-inspired maze solver that visualizes pathfinding algorithms in a randomly generated maze. It demonstrates how *A Search** and *Depth-First Search (DFS)* algorithms work in real time.

## 🚀 Features
- Generates a random maze with walls and open paths.
- Implements *A Search** and *DFS* to find a path from Pac-Man's starting position to the goal.
- Animates Pac-Man’s movement along the solved path.
- Displays the path length for comparison between A* and DFS.
- Allows users to regenerate a new maze dynamically.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- *Python* for logic and algorithms.
- *Pygame* for graphical visualization.
- *PriorityQueue & Stack* for pathfinding implementation.

## 📂 Project Structure
- *Algorithm.py*  Contains A* and DFS implementations.
- *Maze_GUI.py* Handles Pygame rendering and maze generation.
- *Main.py* Runs the game loop and event handling.

## 🎮 How to Run
1. *Install Dependencies*
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
2. Run the main script
   ```bash
   python Main.py
## 🎮 Controls
Press A to solve the maze using A Search*.
Press D to solve using DFS.
Press R to regenerate a new maze.
